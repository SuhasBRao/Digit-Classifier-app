# Digit-Classifier-app
A model that predicts the Digits the user draws.

The app is capable of recognising digits from 0 to 9. 

## Dataset
---
The model was trained using the *MNIST Dataset*. It has around 60000 images in training set.

Currently the accuracy of the app is pretty low. However, it is still under development.

## Model
---
A sequential model was built. You can find more details in [Model_Training.ipynb](./Scripts/Digit_Classifier.ipynb).

The app is now live [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SuhasBRao/Digit-Classifier).

Draw any number between **0 and 9**. The model guesses what you drew.
